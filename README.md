Developed a complete version of the Pacman game with an educational twist using GoDot Software. Programed the large flashing dots to show a math question which must be answered correctly to continue playing. Designed the game to help students under the age of 10 to learn through a fun and challenging way. Created an interactive and appealing menu page including pause and play features.
